# README OF THE 2023 MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT
# Authors: Timoth√©e Charrier et Thomas Ravelet

# Description of the project

This project was done using a Jupyter Notebook. It was done by using VSCode and the Python extension. with Jupyter Notebook, we can run Python code in a browser.
To increase the readability of the code, we used a library called ```Lib``` located in the ```TD_src``` folder. It contains some functions that we used in the project. The ```Lib``` library is imported in the ```CHARRIER_RAVELET_ML_2023ipynb``` file.

Unfortunately, this tricks does not works on Google Colab. So, we had to include the ```Lib``` library in the ```CHARRIER_RAVELET_ML_2023ipynb``` file. This is why the file is quite long on Google Colab. But you can still download it and run it on your computer.
